## Overview

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for detecting credit card fraud using an imbalanced dataset. The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. The goal is to build effective models that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while handling the class imbalance.



## Background

Credit card fraud is a critical issue in financial transactions. Machine learning models can help detect and prevent fraudulent transactions, but dealing with imbalanced data poses challenges. This project explores various techniques to address class imbalance and build effective fraud detection models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains credit card transactions, with features obtained through PCA transformation to ensure confidentiality. Key features include transaction amount, time, and principal components V1-V28. The 'Class' feature indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Data:** Contains the credit card dataset (not provided due to confidentiality) and any generated balanced datasets.
- **Images:** Stores images used in the project, such as banners and visualizations.
- **README.md:** Project documentation and overview.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves scaling the 'Amount' and 'Time' features, shuffling the data, and splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Building and Evaluation

Various machine learning models are developed, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Shallow Neural Network
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Models are evaluated using classification reports to measure precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics.

## Handling Class Imbalance

To address class imbalance, the project creates a balanced dataset with an equal number of fraud and non-fraud transactions. Models are trained on this balanced dataset and evaluated using the validation set.

## Results

The project showcases the performance of different models for credit card fraud detection, considering both the original imbalanced dataset and the balanced dataset. Model evaluation metrics are compared to determine effectiveness.

## How to Use

To run the project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
